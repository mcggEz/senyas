# Senyas - Real-Time ASL Recognition System

## About The Project

Senyas is an American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that combines computer vision and machine learning to provide real-time sign language translation. The project leverages MediaPipe's hand tracking and face mesh capabilities, and my custom made lstm model, to create a comprehensive solution for ASL communication.
